# [242. Valid Anagram][question-link]

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

### Example 1:
```text
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```text
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4^
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
